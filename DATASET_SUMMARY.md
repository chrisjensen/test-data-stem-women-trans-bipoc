## Data Structure Compliance

The dataset fully complies with the updated `test-data-api` requirements:

✅ **Person Interface**: All required fields present (id, fullName, bio, email, phone, picture, tags, groupMemberships)
✅ **Person Optional Fields**: Some entries include reference, quote, and address fields as examples
✅ **Group Interface**: All required fields present (id, name, about, email, website, picture)
✅ **Group Optional Fields**: Some entries include reference fields for verification
✅ **Event Interface**: All required fields present (id, name, date, attendeeIds)
✅ **Data Package Metadata**: Declares containsFirstNationsPeople: false
✅ **Data Integrity**: Unique IDs, valid emails, valid URLs, proper relationships
✅ **Content Quality**: Meaningful bios, descriptions, and names
✅ **Fake Contact Information**: All email addresses use .test domains, phone numbers include 555 as required

## BIO_WRITING_SPEC.md Compliance

All biographical entries follow the specification guidelines:

✅ **Respectful and Substantive**: Honor real scientists with meaningful context
✅ **Factual and Grounded**: Focus on actual scientific contributions and challenges
✅ **Varied Approaches**: Diverse sentence structures and openings
✅ **Realistic Impact**: Describe concrete contributions without oversimplification
✅ **No Formulaic Language**: Each bio is unique and avoids repetitive patterns
✅ **Dignified Tone**: Respectful treatment of real people and their work

## Usage with test-data-api

```typescript
import { stemAchievementsData } from "stem-achievements-data";
import { DataFactory } from "test-data-api";

// Create factory instance
const factory = new DataFactory(stemAchievementsData);

// Get all people
const allScientists = factory.getPeople();

// Get physicists
const physicists = factory.getPeopleByTag("physics");

// Get specific number of people
const sampleScientists = factory.getPeople(5);

// Get people by group
const nasaScientists = factory.getPeopleInGroup("nasa-mathematics");

// Access optional fields
const katherineJohnson = factory.getPerson('katherine-johnson');
console.log(katherineJohnson?.reference); // Reference URL
console.log(katherineJohnson?.quote); // Notable quote
```

## Testing

# Bio Writing Specification for STEM Achievements

## What a Bio SHOULD Be:

### 1. Respectful and Substantive
- Honor real scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who made significant contributions
- Acknowledge the systemic barriers they faced in pursuing STEM careers
- 3-4 sentences providing meaningful context about their work and impact
- Recognize their specific achievements within their field of expertise

### 2. Factual and Grounded
- Focus on their actual scientific contributions, discoveries, and innovations
- Describe the specific challenges they overcame (gender discrimination, racial barriers, etc.)
- Acknowledge the historical context of their work
- Use concrete examples of their research, inventions, or theoretical contributions

### 3. Varied Opening Approaches
- Use diverse sentence structures and openings
- Avoid repetitive formulas across different entries
- Each bio should feel unique to that individual's contributions

### 4. Realistic About Impact
- Highlight how their work impacts our lives today
- Describe concrete scientific contributions they made where applicable
- Acknowledge the ongoing relevance of their work
- Avoid overly broad or simplistic characterisations of the impact of their work
- Recognize the collaborative nature of scientific progress

## What a Bio Should NOT Be:

### 1. Formulaic
- Avoid repetitive patterns like "The X scientist who Y'ed"
- Don't use the same sentence structure across multiple entries
- Reject tagline or marketing-style language
- No cookie-cutter approaches

### 2. Pithy or Trivializing
- No inspirational poster quotes or oversimplified conclusions
- Avoid suggesting discrimination in STEM has been "solved" by their contribution
- Don't reduce complex scientific work to feel-good soundbites
- Reject superficial treatment of serious scientific contributions

### 3. Movie Taglines
- Not entertainment marketing copy
- Avoid dramatic one-liners that treat scientific work lightly
- Don't prioritize "catching attention" over honoring the scientist
- These are real researchers, not fictional characters

### 4. Overly Triumphant
- Don't imply individual achievements solved entire scientific fields
- Acknowledge ongoing nature of scientific challenges
- Avoid language that suggests all barriers are overcome
- Recognize that discrimination in STEM continues today

## Tone Guidelines:

- **Dignified and respectful** - These are real people who deserve honor
- **Acknowledges complexity** - Their work often involved difficult research challenges and systemic barriers
- **Honors innovation** - Recognize their scientific creativity and persistence
- **Recognizes difficulty** - Don't minimize the barriers they faced
- **Present-aware** - Many of the issues they confronted continue today

## Geographic and Cultural Sensitivity:

- Respect the cultural context of their scientific work
- Acknowledge traditional knowledge systems when relevant
- Use appropriate geographic identifiers
- Recognize the global nature of scientific collaboration
- Avoid Eurocentric perspectives on scientific progress
